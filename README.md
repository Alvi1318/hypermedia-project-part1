## Information Architecture

The project follows a single-page structure with a clear vertical layout.  
The header contains the most important information: name, professional title, contact details, and profile photo — ensuring immediate visibility.  

The main content is divided into two columns for optimal readability.  
The left column (60% width) presents time-based and narrative information: work experience and education in reverse chronological order, followed by personal strengths and passions.  
The right column (40%) groups categorical information: professional summary, technical skills organized by category, tools used, and languages.

The sections are clearly divided with uppercase titles and appropriate white space. Visual elements such as icons and colors help quickly identify each section, while the distinctive blue border adds personality without compromising professionalism.

## Visual Design

A limited color palette was chosen: white as a base to maximize readability, shades of gray (#333, #666, #999) for secondary text, and a corporate blue (#4A90E2) as an accent color to convey trust and professionalism.  
This blue is used consistently in headings, company names, links, and the container border.  

The **Inter** typeface is the primary font due to its excellent screen readability and modern aesthetic.  
A clear typographic hierarchy is established: 32px for the name, 18px for subtitles, and progressively smaller sizes for content.  
Font weights (400, 600, 700) create a clear visual hierarchy without the need for extra colors.  

The layout uses **Flexbox** for responsive arrangement.  
Spacing follows a consistent system (8–10px gaps between related elements, 20–35px between sections).  
Interactive elements such as skill tags have a light gray background with subtle borders.  
The circular profile photo and blue border around the main container add personality while maintaining a professional look.

## Design Decisions

1. **Single-page layout** – to simplify navigation and quick scanning  
2. **Dual-column structure** – separates time-based from categorical information  
3. **Single accent color** – blue ensures visual consistency  
4. **Sans-serif typography** – Inter provides maximum readability  
5. **Distinct border** – makes the CV memorable without being intrusive
