## Information Architecture

The project follows a single-page structure with a clear vertical layout.  
The header contains the most important information: name, professional title, contact details, and profile photo — ensuring immediate visibility.  

The main content is divided into two columns for optimal readability.  
The left column (60% width) presents time-based and narrative information: work experience and education in reverse chronological order, followed by personal strengths and passions.  
The right column (40%) groups categorical information: professional summary, technical skills organized by category, tools used, and languages.

## Visual Design

A limited color palette was chosen: white as a base to maximize readability, shades of gray (#333, #666, #999) for secondary text, and a corporate blue (#4A90E2) as an accent color to convey trust and professionalism.  
This blue is used consistently in headings, company names, links, and the container border.  

The **Inter** typeface is the primary font due to its excellent screen readability and modern aesthetic.  
A clear typographic hierarchy is established: 32px for the name, 18px for subtitles, and progressively smaller sizes for content.  
Font weights (400, 600, 700) create a clear visual hierarchy without the need for extra colors.  

The layout uses **Flexbox** for responsive arrangement.  
Spacing follows a consistent system (8–10px gaps between related elements, 20–35px between sections).  
Interactive elements such as skill tags have a light gray background with subtle borders.  
The circular profile photo and blue border around the main container add personality while maintaining a professional look.

## 🎯 Design Decisions

1. **Single-page layout** – to simplify navigation and quick scanning  
2. **Dual-column structure** – separates time-based from categorical information  
3. **Single accent color** – blue ensures visual consistency  
4. **Sans-serif typography** – Inter provides maximum readability  
5. **Distinct border** – makes the CV memorable without being intrusive
